    "title": "A Review of Inge Druckrey‚Äôs Teaching to See",
    "section": "",
    "text": "September 10th, 2025\nReview by Joseph Martinez\nInge Druckrey was a graphic designer, an abstract artist, a typographer, and above all else, a teacher. She inspired a generation of artists and graphic designers, and the work of her field has left an impression on the likes of Apple Inc.¬†founder and CEO Steve Jobs. Druckrey‚Äôs minimalism in her art and designs establishes captivating images, providing inspiration and structure for aspiring data analysts.\nOne of the most crucial lessons an analyst can take from Druckrey‚Äôs work is bold minimalism. Druckrey states that when her student‚Äôs work is complete, ‚ÄúThere is nothing unnecessary.‚Äù As an analyst, noise in visualizations could weaken and dilute the conviction behind the story the analyst‚Äôs visualization. Druckrey trained this in her students by creating limitations to the organization of their canvases, much in the way a comic book panelist limits the size and frames of their images to enhance, and not sacrifice, the flow of the comic‚Äôs story. In the typography of an alphabet, this is done through the careful contrast of thin and thick strokes and curves versus lines. These contrasts become especially important when addressing the paradox of geographic and optical accuracy. For you see, just because two lines are drawn the same length does not mean the lines will appear the same to the eye. Students must be taught how to adjust their typography and designs to appear as intended to be seen, even if this comes at the expense of true geographic accuracy. However, at the end of the day, it is up to the designer of the typography to express their own work.\nFor this reason, Druckrey would always allow her students to just throw an idea onto the canvas. Then, Druckrey would ‚Äúmove in carefully and direct‚Äù the student towards a final product. Likewise, each analyst must come up with their own style; it may start off as messy, unkempt, and in need of cultivation, but like a signature, it needs the expression of the analyst.\nData analysts turn numbers into stories. Or as Kris Holmes explains, there is a contrast between what we as people wish to see and what we wish to write. The eye ‚Äúwants everything perfect and rational‚Äù; however, our hands write quickly and with passion. Likewise, when we tell stories with data, although our end product must be neat, concise, and legible to others, it will fail to convey if our passion and expression cannot be felt within the design.\nEven Steve Jobs, who took calligraphy classes as a dropout at Reed College, recognized the importance of these lessons of passion expressed through bold minimalism. He took these lessons and brought them to the design of the first Macintosh computer, describing these computers as ‚Äúthe first computer with beautiful typography.‚Äù The simple and bold design of these first household computers is what opened the door to a brand whose simple logo is in the hands of most Americans to this very day.\nThere is a quote from Druckrey that has stuck with me the past few nights as I go about editing this rambling of the bold minimalism she inspires. ‚ÄúGraphic design is always visualizing an idea, and it‚Äôs definitely about drawing attention. It‚Äôs about informing; it‚Äôs about distance reading. But it‚Äôs also about symbolizing something, because like poetry, you have to get the essence of something.‚Äù I believe this is not just relevant to data visualization and art but also to how we carry about our lives. The signatures we leave upon this world can be chaotic and uncultivated and later in life refined into grand impact. Regardless of our success in challenging our chaos into order, in our hearts, as we express our lives upon the page of our time on this earth, we are poets.\nSource: Severny, A. 2012.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Septtember 24th, 2025\nData in Journalism vs.¬†Academia\nBy Joseph Martinez\nIn McGhee‚Äôs documentary film, ‚ÄúJournalism in the Age of Data,‚Äù McGhee has several graphic designers and data journalists at the forefront of the infographic revolution that began at the dawn of the 21st century. Several journalists, such as The New York Times‚Äô Amanda Cox and BBC‚Äôs Scott Byrne-Fraser, can showcase how impactful creative data visualizations can be in helping guide the members of the public through information that would otherwise be too abstract or overwhelming to grasp. Cox was able to clearly show the impact race, sex, and education played on unemployment rates over time through an interactive graph that was captivating in its subject matter, approachable in its simplicity, and most importantly impactful because of how it incentivized the reader to interact with the graph to gain the information. Bryne-Fraser expands upon this need for news visualizations to be interactive, leading the reader to the information in steps, starting small, then expanding out. Else, the whole visualization may still overwhelm the reader. This is a concept expanded upon by Nigel Holmes, who explained how impactful visualization becomes once placed in a video format, leading a viewer towards the findings of data.\nMuch of McGhee‚Äôs second half of the film explores the clash between two different aspects of journalism, the mission to keep the public informed and the need to create profit. Visualizations can often be beautiful but pointless. Sarah Slobin tells the story of a visualization of the Fortune 500‚Äôs revenue designed to create the image of a flower; however, there was almost no practical use one could obtain from the flower‚Äîit just looked pretty. Stunning visuals over useful ones are often the ones to be rewarded within the infographic community, as pointed out by journalist Alberto Cairo. And even Bryne-Fraser talks about collaborating more with the television news graphics team at BBC, whom he admits ‚Äúhas a huge skill base in motion graphics, but not necessarily a huge skill base in information graphics.‚Äù This runs counter to data visualization in academia, where the primary concern is conveying the data effectively. The message, nor the integrity of the underlying data, cannot be sacrificed to make an academic visualization look more appealing, although a pleasant-looking graphic is still paramount to an academic data visualization."
