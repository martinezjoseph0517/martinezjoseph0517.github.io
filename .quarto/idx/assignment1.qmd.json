Although not the most atrocious chart when it comes to malice or misinformation, this pie chart out about North Carolina's disabled population was most definitely the most confusing. Although one can assume that those 65 and older would make up a disproportionately larger part of the population, having the disabled population represented by the out pie chart causes confusion. The disabled population is most definitely smaller than the total population of North Carolina's total population, yet the disabled population represents the larger outside rim of the chart. To the eye, it would seem intuitive that the outer rim would of represented the total population, and no where in the graphic is there any labels that could prevent this false assumption. It is only while reading the Smith's corresponding article that one would gain the context necessary to properly read the pie chart.
